# Replacements

Strings in some cases can get replaced to certain things depending on the keyword.

For instance ".tv blue $word$" could search youtube for "blue bird".

These replacements happen at the moment of sending a message or changing media.

These replacements exist:

{{ user }}
{{ noun }}
{{ a_noun }}
{{ nouns }}
{{ adjective }}
{{ an_adjective }}

# More

The bot accepts and processes private messages (whispers) if the user is an admin.

Which can be useful to make more direct calls to the bot (without spamming the chat).

For instance "/whisper2 myBot > .q tv next".

The bot can join multiple rooms at startup if the id is included in room_ids. To join or leave rooms after it's started you can use .join or .leave
